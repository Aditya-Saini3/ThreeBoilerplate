# ThreeBoilerplate

This is the boilerplate I'm using for my Three.js tutorials.

Wanna use it? okay then just follow these simple steps:

1. Fork the repository;
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio code;
3. Open the terminal, type this command: npm install
4. Ctrl + click on the server link "http://localhost:1234" to open the app in your browser;
5. Have fun!
